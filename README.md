# SPOT’A’HOME REACT

This is a React version to be added to the previous responsive jquery version. 

In this solution I strive, in the minimal time I have, to showcase JSX, ES6 and REACT. 

This is based on the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) template meaning it has many more components such as Babbel and webpack.

## Requirements 
This app requires node.js

## Installation
1. Install node.js
2. Pull the repository and unpack in a directory of your choice
3. Start the server by issuing *npm start*

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
